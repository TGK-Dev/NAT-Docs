# Configuration

For work on the payout system, you will need to set the following settings

* [Claim Channel](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* [Queue Channel](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]
* [Payout Channel](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]
* [Claim Time](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]
* [Payout Mangers](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]
* [Staff Roles](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]

These settings can be adjusted using the /serversettings command to manage and customize your payout system effectively.





[^1]: Choose the channel where notifications for new payouts will be shown. This allows users to easily locate and claim their payouts.

[^2]: Opt for a channel where successfully claimed payouts will be systematically organized. This ensures efficient tracking and management.

[^3]: Specify the channel where users can conduct transactions swiftly using the `/payout express` command.

[^4]: Define the timeframe during which users are permitted to claim their payouts. This helps maintain a structured and timely process.

[^5]: Assign specific role with the authority to review and approve claimed and unclaimed payouts. This adds a layer of control and security.

[^6]: Assign specific roles to staff members. This grants them the ability to initiate payouts while maintaining accountability by restricting them to reject only their own transactions.
