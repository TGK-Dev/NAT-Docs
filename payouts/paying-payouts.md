# Paying Payouts

[<mark style="color:blue;">/payout express</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] This command is made to improve the efficiency of the Dank Memer payout process. It helps to clean the payout queue fast.

## How it works:

• This command identifies the 25 oldest payouts for Normal Servers and 50 payouts for premium servers in the queue that need to be done.

• When you run the **Dank Memer** payout command and confirm payout, the payout express automatically marks the payout as paid in the queue and moves on to the next oldest payout.
