# The Payout Guide

This guide will show you how to use the /payout create command, which helps event and giveaway managers set up a queue for prizes that members can claim in a specific time frame.

Using this command can save time and reduce misunderstandings, making it easier for you to run your events and giveaways smoothly. In this guide, we'll review the steps to use the command properly.\

We hope this guide helps you organize your events and giveaways more efficiently.

## **Before using the payout create command, make sure to gather the following information:**

* [ ] Event/Giveaway Name
* [ ] Message ID where the winners are mentioned or the event winner announcement message ID
* [ ] Winners (you can use both mentions and id but they need to add at least one space between each)
* [ ] Prize quantity
* [ ] Item (if needed)

Ensure all this information is ready before using the payout create command. This will help make the payout process smoother and more efficient.

## When entering the arguments, make sure to follow these guidelines:



* Don't enter the item and quantity in the `quantity` argument.

* When entering the prize quantity, use one of the following formats: 1m, 1e6, or 1.5m. These formats represent million (m), exponent (e6), and million and a half (1.5m), respectively.
